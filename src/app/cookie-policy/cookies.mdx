# COOKIE POLICY

**Last updated: August 15, 2025**

This Cookie Policy explains how **Big Pixel Consulting Ltd.** ("**Company**", "**we**", "**us**", "**our**") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at <https://big-pixel.com> (the "**Website**"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.


<h2 id="what-are-cookies">What are cookies?</h2>

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, **Big Pixel Consulting Ltd.**) are called **first‑party cookies**. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called **third‑party cookies**. Third‑party cookies enable third‑party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third‑party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.


<h2 id="why-we-use-cookies">Why do we use cookies?</h2>

We use first‑ and third‑party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as **"essential"** or **"strictly necessary"** cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our online properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.


<h2 id="control-cookies">How can I control cookies?</h2>

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the **Cookie Consent Manager**. The manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. **Essential cookies cannot be rejected** as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.

The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.

The specific types of first‑ and third‑party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described below (note: the specific cookies served may vary depending on the online properties you visit):

<h2 id="other-tech">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like **web beacons** (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor traffic patterns between pages, deliver or communicate with cookies, understand whether you arrived from an online advertisement, improve site performance, and measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies rely on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies may impair their functioning.


<h2 id="flash-cookies">Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>

Websites may also use **Flash Cookies** (also known as Local Shared Objects or "**LSOs**") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, for fraud prevention, and for other site operations.

If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player:

- [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)
- [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html)

Please note that restricting Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.


<h2 id="ads">Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>

Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that may interest you, and to measure ad effectiveness. The information collected through this process does not enable us (or them) to identify you directly unless you choose to provide such details.


<h2 id="updates">How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h2>

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
