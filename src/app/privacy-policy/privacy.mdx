<h3 id="autocollect">Information automatically collected</h3>

**In Short:** *Some information — such as your IP address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.*

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information (such as IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information). This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more in our Cookie Notice: <https://big-pixel.com/cookie-policy>.

**The information we collect includes:**

- *Device Data.* Information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services (e.g., IP address or proxy, device and app IDs, location, browser type, hardware model, ISP/mobile carrier, OS, and system configuration).
- *Location Data.* Information about your device's location, which can be precise or imprecise (e.g., via IP). You can opt out by refusing access or disabling Location on your device; doing so may affect some features.


<h2 id="infouse">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

**In Short:** *We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.*

We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:

- **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.**
- **To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.**
- **To enable user-to-user communications**, where applicable.
- **To save or protect an individual's vital interest**, such as to prevent harm.


<h2 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

*In Short:* **We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason** (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.

The GDPR and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on. We may rely on the following legal bases:

- **Consent.** You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about [withdrawing your consent](#withdrawconsent).
- **Performance of a Contract.** To fulfil our contractual obligations to you.
- **Legal Obligations.** For compliance with our legal obligations (e.g., cooperating with law enforcement, exercising/defending legal rights).
- **Vital Interests.** To protect your vital interests or those of a third party.

In legal terms, we are generally the **"data controller"** under European data protection laws for the personal information described in this Privacy Notice. This notice does not apply to personal information we process as a **"data processor"** on behalf of our customers. In those situations the customer is the data controller.


<h2 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels). Some help maintain security, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save preferences, and assist with basic site functions. We also permit certain third parties/service providers to use technologies for analytics and advertising. Specific information and choices are set out in our Cookie Notice: <https://big-pixel.com/cookie-policy>.


<h2 id="inforetain">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (e.g., tax/accounting). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need, we will delete or anonymise your information, or securely store and isolate it until deletion is possible.


<h2 id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

*In Short:* **We aim to protect your personal information through organisational and technical security measures.**

We implement appropriate and reasonable measures to protect personal information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk; you should access the Services within a secure environment.
